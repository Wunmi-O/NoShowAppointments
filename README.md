# Project NoShowAppointments

This dataset for this project collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row. 
The need for this analysis was important to finding out what factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment.
